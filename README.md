# Dynamic Delegate

Dynamic Delegate is a small library for dynamically creating implementations of the Business Delegate J2EE design pattern.

See [an example](http://www.tzavellas.com/projects/dyndelegate/examples.html) of how you can use Dynamic Delegate in your code.

For more information please read the [FAQ](http://www.tzavellas.com/projects/dyndelegate/faq.html) of the project.

I got the idea to implement this project after reading Brett McLaughlin's [EJB best practices: The dynamic delegate](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ejb1119.html) article.
